# ML-Classifier-Project
This is a simple machine learning project that evaluates the acceptability of a car by using gaussian naive bayes method on a dataset.
I created a simple classification model on the [Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) from the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
